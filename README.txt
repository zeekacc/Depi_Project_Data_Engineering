The Retail Inventory Management and Forecas ng project is powered by 
LaptopDB, an integrated database and analy cs solu on designed to 
manage a detailed inventory of laptops and related components. The 
project centers around a SQL Server database, LaptopDB, which organizes 
informa on across mul ple tables, including ProductDetails for product 
specifica ons (CPU, storage, GPU, RAM, display size, etc.), Suppliers for 
vendor informa on, InventoryLevels for tracking stock, FactSales for sales 
data, and Product for general product details. 
Data is extracted and processed using Python libraries like pyodbc and 
pandas, allowing efficient querying, transforma on, and merging of data 
from different tables. For example, the ProductDetails table is merged 
with Suppliers, FactSales, and InventoryLevels to provide a holis c view of 
each productâ€™s lifecycle, from procurement and inventory to final sales. 
This consolidated data structure makes it easy to track key metrics such as 
top-selling products, supplier performance, inventory turnover, and price 
trends. 
The goal of this project is to provide comprehensive insights into 
inventory and sales, suppor ng data-driven decision-making in 
procurement, sales strategy, and inventory management. Ul mately, 
LaptopDB serves as a robust founda on for analyzing product trends and 
opmizing business opera ons related to laptops and accessories.
