 Project Description:
 This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the Airbnb Chicago dataset using Power BI to gain meaningful insights into the listings, hosts, and overall rental market in Chicago. The goal of the project is to create an interactive dashboard that provides both high-level overviews and in-depth analysis of various aspects of Airbnb listings in the city. The dataset includes information on room types, prices, availability, number of reviews, and other key factors that influence both guests and hosts. By utilizing Power BI's visualization capabilities, we aim to highlight patterns, trends, and correlations within the data, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
